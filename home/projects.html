            <p>
                I have commited myself to dipping my hands in as many different paints as possible, so that I may one day look back upon my life and admire the beauty of progress. Leaving a trail of color in my wake.
            </p>
            <p>
                On that note, I have a lot of projects, most being unfinished, ongoing, or forgotten.

                <ul>
                    <li>My personal website (which I will not be linking here), as I made it at a minimum 6 years ago. It could be up to 8 years old. It's gross. I've included a sample at the bottom of this page.</li>
                    <li>I've made a website for my friends' band, <a href="https://acidfog.com">Acid Fog</a>. They do not use it.</li>
                    <li>Recently, I worked on a website for <span class="hover" title="the University of Illinois, Springfield">UIS</span>'s Orion Lab using Svelte. I have the <a href="https://github.com/Spar3Chang3/Orion-Labs">source code</a> available on GitHub </li>
                    <li>I record and edit countless videos. I'm aiming to get myself into a more professional space with my videography.</li>
                    <li>I have several servers set up at my home, running services facing the public, and personal servers, such as a local <span class="hover" title="Network Attached Storage, basically a local server that stores all of my computer files">NAS</span></li>
                    <li>I've assembled several computers, and I act as a refuge for <span class="hover" title="e-waste is made up of aging electronics that are considered outdated, or are otherwise disposed of.">e-waste</span>. Old <span title="Personal Computers" class="hover">PCs</span> make the perfect machines to host my whimsical services</li>
