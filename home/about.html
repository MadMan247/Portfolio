                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hi, <span class="hover" title="Edward Anderson, for those who forgot">I‚Äôm me</span>! I like building weird stuff, eating snacks, and pressing buttons to see what happens. My cat thinks they‚Äôre the boss, but they‚Äôre wrong (mostly). üêæ</p>


                <p>I love coding, gadgets, and making things that sometimes break‚Äîbut that‚Äôs part of the fun! Welcome to my lair of chaos and awesomeness. üöÄ‚ú®</p>

                <p>Did you know that escape sequences are goofy in html? Check this out! &hearts; is not an emoji!</p>

                <p>Gotta run! Mom says I can't stay up longer than 8 pm... don't tell her it's 8:07!1!!</p>

    <h2>Some Background</h2>
        <p>I have been a human since a very young age. At one point of time, I was tied for the position of &quot;youngest human to ever exist&quot;... It has been many years since I got that title, and I haven&apos;t competed since.</p>
        <p>I have several interests that you may also find to be interesting. These interests are largely software for computers.</p>
